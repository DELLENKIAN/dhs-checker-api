"""
Module that encapsulates the logic for logging into the NCR Debt Help System
and extracting debt review information for a list of RSA ID numbers.

The `check_ids` coroutine defined in this module will open a headless
Chromium browser via Playwright, log into the Debt Help System using
credentials stored in environment variables (``DHS_USERNAME`` and
``DHS_PASSWORD``) and then iterate over each ID number, performing a
search and scraping the resulting status and debt counsellor trading
name.  It returns a list of dictionaries containing the scraped
information.

Because the Debt Help System is an ASP.NET Web Forms application
with complex postbacks and dynamic identifiers, the exact selectors
required to perform the search may change over time.  This module
contains reasonable defaults based on the markup available at the
time of writing.  If the scraping fails due to selector changes you
may need to update the CSS selectors and wait conditions below.

Note: This module assumes that the Playwright dependency has been
installed via ``playwright install chromium``.  When deploying to
Railway, ensure that the ``railway.json`` file includes a
``postinstall`` script to install the browser binaries.  See
``requirements.txt`` and ``railway.json`` in the repository root.
